## LOCAL-AUTH EXAMPLE FOR DEVMTN STUDENTS

### STEP 1. CLONE REPO
### STEP 2. NPM INSTALL (run npm i inside project folder where the package.json file is)
### STEP 3. CREATE A CONFIG.JS FILE AND SET IT UP THE WAY I HAVE SHOWN YOU IN THE INDEX.JS FILE
### STEP 4. RUN MONGOD
### STEP 5. RUN NODEMON ON THE INDEX.JS FILE
### STEP 5. GO TO YOUR BROWSER AND GO TO YOUR LOCALHOST PORT NUMBER - YOU SHOULD SEE THE LOGIN PAGE
### STEP 6. POST A NEW USER ON POSTMAN (USERNAME, PASSWORD, AGE)
### STEP 7. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOG IN WITH YOUR NEW USERNAME AND PASSWORD NOW

*** THIS IS A VERY BASIC EXAMPLE FOR AUTH. THE SECURITY FOR THIS IS TERRIBLE, SO PLEASE DON'T BE DUMB AND MAKE A PROJECT USING THIS AND STORE IMPORTANT DATA SUCH AS CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, SS NUMBERS, OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD POSSIBLY RUIN YOUR LIFE IF IT WERE IN THE WRONG HANDS. THANK YOU. *
